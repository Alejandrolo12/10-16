AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML, but most people use JSON instead of XML now
JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation
JSON is the most common way of storing data in Javascript
Data is stored in objects, like hashes
For example, you have a variable cat that has a name, species, and favorite food. Name, species, favFood are keys, and the values would be “Meowsalot”, “cat”, and “fish”. Values can be accessed by calling the corresponding key of the object. Several these hashes can be stored together in an array as a JSON object
AJAX likes to call data from a different source, a XML file, a JSON file, etc
JSON actually makes syntax much cleaner than with XML because it is JS and we can just call corresponding keys and values

Applications
